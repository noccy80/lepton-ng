1. Global installation
======================

 * Place the 'sys' folder in a path accessible on your PHP include path.
 * You probably have to set the SYS_PATH environment variable too, see below.
 * Requiring "sys/base.php" should now kickstart things properly.

2. Local installation
=====================

 * To use the console scripts with a local installation, symlink the ../sys/ folder into the bin folder.
 * The scripts should now work out of the box.

3. Making sure the files can be found
=====================================

 * You can also use the LEPTON_PATH, SYS_PATH and APP_PATH environment variables. Unless explicitly defined,
   the base path is used for all three paths. The LEPTON_PATH points to the root of the project, while the
   SYS_PATH and APP_PATH points to the folder CONTAINING the app and sys folders respectively.
