1. Global installation
======================

 * Place the 'sys' folder in a path accessible on your PHP include path.
 * Requiring "sys/base.php" should now kickstart things properly.

2. Local installation
=====================

 * To use the console scripts with a local installation, symlink the ../sys/ folder into the bin folder
