Web Development with Lepton
===========================

Where it all starts
-------------------

A Web Application is centered around the MvcApplication class. Unless you got
something insane in mind, this should work out of the box. There is no need
to derive classes from the MvcApplication class, but rather just make sure 
that it is loaded from your index.php file:

  <?php
      require('sys/base.php');
      ModuleManager::load('lepton.base.mvc');
      Lepton::run('MvcApplication');
  ?>

The next step would be to set up your default controller and create the needed
methods. The controller should go into /app/controllers/default.php and the
class should be named "DefaultController". All controller instances must
inherit from the Controller class.

For testing you are OK with just an index method:

  <?php
      class DefaultController extends Controller {
          function index() { View::load('default/index.php'); }
      }
  ?>

Now all that's left is the view. The views contain all your HTML and the first
view should go into /app/views/default/index.php. That is the view we loaded
in the above example class.

Now, assuming everything is properly set up in your web server, you should be
able to browse to your site and view your index view.


Testing your site
-----------------

Direct invocation of specific controller and method. The following command
will attempt to invoke the index method of the default controller with the
two parameters "foo" and "bar". With the default router, this would be the
same as browsing to "/default/index/foo/bar".

  $ bin/viewpage -c default index foo bar | w3m -T text/html

Routed invocation of specificic URL. This will make your request pass through
the router rather than invoking the controller directly. This allows you to
inspect the performance of your router.

  $ bin/viewpage -r / | w3m -T text/html

w3m is a tiny text-based web browser that is capable of rendering pages from
an input stream. Just remember to specify -T for content type or you will get
plain text.

  $ bin/viewpage -h
