Debugging HowTo
===============

In order to debug your project, simply set the DEBUG environment variable to 1
and watch the fireworks:

  $ DEBUG=1 bin/myscript

The above command will put Lepton in debugging mode and all relevant information
will be output to the console window. You can also specify a dedicated debug file
using the LOGFILE environment variable:

  $ DEBUG=1 LOGFILE=myscript.log bin/myscript

The debug output will now be made available to the file myscript.log

Please note that the output log is NOT appended to, but overwritten by each
consequitive run.

You can increase the log level to widen the granularity of what is logged.

Adding debugging code
---------------------

In order to allow for debugging, simply call on Console::debug() with a format
string and the data in the same format as used by printf(). This information
will be output if debugging is enabled.

You can also use the Console::warn() with the same parameter setup to cause a
warning to be output even if debugging is disabled.

There is also a Console::fatal() method to indicate a fatal error.
