Writing applications
====================

Applications are classes derived from the ConsoleApplication or ConsoleService
class. There are also a few additional derived variants of ConsoleApplication
which of the most interesting would be CursesApplication. This class serves a
ncurses-based application framework straight to your script.

Methods needed by all ConsoleApplications
-----------------------------------------

 * public main($argc,$argv) - Program entrypoint
 * public usage() - Usage helper, invoked if -h is on the command line.
 * protected $arguments - Command line arguments accepted

Differences between ConsoleApplication and MvcApplication
---------------------------------------------------------

The MVC application is used to invoke controllers to produce views. It
therefore doesn't contain a main() method nor does it allow any usage
information to be presented.

Differences between ConsoleApplication and ConsoleService
---------------------------------------------------------

The console service contains facilities to allow it to be detached from
the active console, letting it run in the background. This is done with
a call to $this->fork() from within the application.
