Writing applications
====================

Applications are classes derived from the ConsoleApplication or ConsoleService
class. Depending on if you are writing an application or a service you need to
implement a few methods:

ConsoleApplication
------------------
 * public main($argc,$argv) - Program entrypoint
 * public usage() - Usage helper, invoked if -h is on the command line.
 * protected $arguments - Command line arguments accepted

ConsoleService
--------------
 * public main($argc,$argv) - Main service entrypoint
 * public usage() - Usage helper, same as above
 * protected $arguments - Command line arguments accepted
