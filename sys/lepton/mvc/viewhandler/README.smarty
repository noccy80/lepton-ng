Download and install smarty into your prefered location. The defaults for lng
is to place it in /app/Smarty and store templates in /app/views/templates. As
long as you stick to these, you can pretty much copy the smarty.orig file to
smarty.php (in your app/config directory) and start loading .tpl templates.
