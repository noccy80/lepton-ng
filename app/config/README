What goes in here?
==================

 - Your configuration files as .php
 - Any overridden setting from sys/defaults.php
 
What is loaded?
---------------

  Only the files named .php are loaded. This means that you can rename your
  files to prevent them from being loaded on startup.

  This is also cleverly used by lepton to provide defaults, contained in the
  .orig files. These files normally just contain the original settings (and
  in some cases the code needed to load the functionality) so you can take
  any .orig file and copy it to .php file and off you go!
